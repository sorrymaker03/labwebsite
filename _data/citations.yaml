  description: "Some cancers evade targeted therapies through a mechanism known as\
    \ lineage plasticity, whereby tumor cells acquire phenotypic characteristics of\
    \ a cell lineage whose survival no longer depends on the drug target. We use in\
    \ vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models to show that these tumors can\
    \ develop resistance to the antiandrogen drug enzalutamide by a phenotypic shift\
    \ from androgen receptor (AR)\u2013dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent\
    \ basal-like cells. This lineage plasticity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and\
    \ RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription\
    \ factor SOX2, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting\
    \ SOX2 expression. Thus, mutations in tumor suppressor genes can create a state\
    \ of increased cellular plasticity that, when challenged with antiandrogen therapy,\
    \ promotes resistance through lineage switching."
