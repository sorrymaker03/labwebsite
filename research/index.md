Our lab is dedicated to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that drive resistance to targeted and immune therapies in prostate and other cancers. We are also pioneering innovative therapeutic strategies to overcome these resistances, utilizing a range of state-of-the-art techniques, including 3D-cultured organoids, single-cell sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics.
